extended-description = """Angle-grinder allows you to parse, aggregate, sum, average, percentile, and sort your data. \
                        You can see it, live-updating, in your terminal. Angle grinder is designed for when, for \
                        whatever reason, you don't have your data in graphite/honeycomb/kibana/sumologic/splunk/etc. \
                        but still want to be able to do sophisticated analytics. \
                        Angle grinder can process about a million rows per second, so it's usable for fairly meaty \
                        aggregation. The results will live update in your terminal as data is processed. \
                        Angle grinder is a bare bones functional programming language coupled with a pretty terminal UI."""
